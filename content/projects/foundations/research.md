# Ontology

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)>

In [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system "Information system") and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), where an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_\(information_science\) "Ontology (information science)") refers to a specific vocabulary and a set of explicit assumptions about the meaning and usage of these words, an ontological commitment is an agreement to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner within a specific context.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_commitment#cite_note-Guarino-2)

The notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an [inference engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_engine "Inference engine"), by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The [inference rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_rules "Inference rules") are commonly specified by means of an [ontology language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_language "Ontology language"), and often a [description logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic "Description logic") language.
