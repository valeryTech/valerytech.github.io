questions from the 'asking the great questions' article

Stakeholder communication will be a critical component to your success. Be prepared to provide compelling answers to questions such as:
• Why are we doing this?
• Why does it have to be done now?
• What will happen if we don't do it?
• How does it impact me? How will I benefit?
• How will this benefit the organization?
• When will it go into effect?
• Why are we doing a slow integration rather than all at once?
• How does this affect my job? My pay?
• How much additional time will this add when it comes to hiring employees, performance reviews, talent reviews, etc.?
• How will we know if this is successful?
