# Laws

Things that seemed universally true about software architecture. These three laws seem pretty universal and inform many important perspectives for working software architects.

{{< callout context="note" title="First Law" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.
{{< /callout >}}

Corollary 1
If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade-off, more likely they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet.

Corollary 2
You can't do trade-off analysis just once; it's a continuous process because things change.

{{< callout context="note" title="Second Law" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
WHY is more important than HOW.
{{< /callout >}}

We define software architecture in terms beyond structural scaffolding, incorporating principles, characteristics, and so on. Architecture is broader than just the combination of structural elements.

why? examples?

{{< callout context="note" title="Third Law" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Most architectral decisions aren't binary but rather exist on a spectrum between extremes.
