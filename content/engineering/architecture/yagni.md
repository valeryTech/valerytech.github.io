analyse, esp this one: "People confuse YAGNI with, "We don't need it right now," all the time. If there's one common thread I see among software engineers, it's that they don't think long term. They don't think like an owner of whatever the problem is. Then the stakeholders come back asking for something that an owner would have told you was obviously coming, and they have coded themselves into a wall where a major re-architecture is needed to facilitate that future requirement."
