(filler, in progress)

**TL;DR:** This page presents various foundational concepts, principles, methods, patterns, heuristics, and best practices related to software architecture. 

# Practicality Lens

Different authors ans scholars highlight numerous diverse concepts for building software systems. There is a wide range of concept types: (best) practices, approaches, methods, laws, principles, theories, heuristics, and more. 

However, what matters most to me is the ability to adapt and employ this variety as a **practical toolbox** for creating effective systems. 

> Looking ahead, my key focus will be to develop a **holistic set** of tools, clearly structured and integrated, for practical use in software architecture and design.

# Toolbox

One notable example is provided by Mark Richards and Neal Ford, who identified several universally applicable ideas about software architecture and codified them as "laws." You can find more details about these laws in the [Laws]({{< ref "engineering/architecture/toolbox" >}}#laws) section.

.. (insert additional tools here) ..

Additionally, I could include concepts such as the definition of software architecture itself or definitions of architectural characteristics. Why include them? Because these definitions help us build clearer models and enhance our understanding of software systems. However, in my opinion, these definitions represent a broader and more general set of instruments or conceptual foundations that engineers or architects rely upon. While you genuinely use them, I've decided not to explicitly categorize them as part of the toolbox—but it's essential to recognize their implicit role in architectural practice.

Concepts such as the definition of software architecture or architectural characteristics could also fit into this toolbox, as they guide our understanding and modeling of software systems. However, I've chosen not to explicitly include these foundational definitions as part of the toolbox, viewing them instead as general conceptual instruments that underlie our practical work. Nevertheless, keep in mind their implicit importance and usage.

I also considered adding fundamental concepts like the definition of software architecture and architectural characteristics. Although we constantly use these definitions to form clear mental models, I view them as broader instruments or conceptual foundations rather than specific tools. Thus, I’ve decided not to explicitly list them within the toolbox, but it's important to remember that these foundational ideas are always in practical use.
