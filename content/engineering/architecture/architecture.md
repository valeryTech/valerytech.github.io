# Laws

Some authors state some unifying elements in the form of laws. For example ...

{{< callout context="note" title="First Law " icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.
{{< /callout >}}

Corollary 1
If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade-off, more likely they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet.

Corollary 2
You can't do trade-off analysis just once; it's a continuous process because things change.

{{< callout context="caution" title="Second Law " icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
WHY is more important than HOW.
{{< /callout >}}

We define software architecture in terms beyond structural scaffolding, incorporating principles, characteristics, and so on. Architecture is broader than just the combination of structural elements.
why? examples


**Third Law** Most architectral decisions aren't binary but rather exist on a spectrum between extremes.
