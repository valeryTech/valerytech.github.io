(filler, in progress)

**TL;DR:** This page presents various foundational concepts, principles, methods, patterns, heuristics, and best practices related to software architecture. 

# Definition

# Ontology

basic concepts


# Practicality Lens

Different authors ans scholars highlight numerous diverse concepts for building software systems. There is a wide range of concept types: (best) practices, approaches, methods, laws, principles, theories, heuristics, and more. 

However, what matters most to me is the ability to adapt and employ this variety as a **practical toolbox** for creating effective systems. 

> Looking ahead, my key focus will be to develop a **holistic set** of tools, clearly structured and integrated, for practical use in software architecture and design.

A key challenge in this pursuit is that principles can sometimes conflict and contradict each other. The real question is not just which principles to follow but *how to balance and apply them effectively* to the problem at hand.

# Toolbox

One notable example is provided by Mark Richards and Neal Ford, who identified several universally applicable ideas about software architecture and codified them as "laws." You can find more details about these laws in the [Laws]({{< ref "engineering/architecture/toolbox" >}}#laws) section.

.. (insert other tools here) ..

Concepts such as the definition of software architecture or architectural characteristics could also fit into this toolbox, as they guide our understanding and modeling of software systems. However, I've chosen not to explicitly include these foundational definitions as part of the toolbox, viewing them instead as general conceptual instruments that underlie our practical work. Nevertheless, keep in mind their implicit importance and usage.

# Architectural Characteristics

list of characteristics, applicability, mapping to the parts of the system, definitions, how to specify them

# Decisions

paper "Decision-Making Techniques for Software Architecture Design: A Comparative Survey" 

Software architects must understand and analyze software systems deeply, in all their complexity, and must make important trade-off decisions, sometimes with incomplete information (analyze). Software architects make exactly the kinds of decisions that AI cannot, evaluating trade-offs within complex, changing contexts. 

Architecture, like much art, can only be understood in context. Architects base their decisions on the realities of their environment.
