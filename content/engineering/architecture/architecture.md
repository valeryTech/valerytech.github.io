# Laws

(they added reflection)
As your two authors set out to write the first edition of this book, we had an ambitious goal: we hoped to find things that seemed universally true about software architecture and codify them as “laws” of software architecture. As we wrote, we kept our eyes peeled for things we could capture; we had hoped to find maybe 10 or 15. To our surprise, we ended up identifying just two laws in the first edition, and uncovered one more while writing the second. True to our original intent, these three laws seem pretty universal and inform many important perspectives for working software architects.

Just about every example in this book has illustrated these laws, which points to their origin story. When we wrote the first edition, we hoped to find numerous things that seemed universally true about software architecture and codify them as _laws_. To our surprise, we ended up identifying just two laws in the first edition, then uncovered one more while writing the second. True to our original intent, these three laws seem pretty universal and inform many important perspectives for working software architects.

{{< callout context="note" title="First Law " icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.
{{< /callout >}}

Corollary 1
If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade-off, more likely they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet.

Corollary 2
You can't do trade-off analysis just once; it's a continuous process because things change.

{{< callout context="note" title="Second Law " icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
WHY is more important than HOW.
{{< /callout >}}

We define software architecture in terms beyond structural scaffolding, incorporating principles, characteristics, and so on. Architecture is broader than just the combination of structural elements.

why? examples?

{{< callout context="note" title="Third Law " icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Most architectral decisions aren't binary but rather exist on a spectrum between extremes.
