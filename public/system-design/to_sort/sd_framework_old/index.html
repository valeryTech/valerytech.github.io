<p>how candidate reason about scalability and availability?
frame an interviewer that you understand that your system would need to be distributed (in some scenarios)
design the system to be scalable</p>
<p>interview: make reasonable design choice and justify it</p>
<p>What you do is important, but how you communicate is even more important.</p>
<p>An interviewer is not expecting exactly correct answers that correspond with a rubric. There is, in fact, no &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer. Instead, they want to see comprehension of the problem at hand. A good interviewee will lead a conversant and comfortable walk through of their assumptions, calculations, trade-offs, and design choices.</p>
<p>Questions you may want to keep in mind include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we tell that the system is working?</li>
<li>Is there a bottleneck in the design?</li>
<li>If there are multiple components, what are the APIs and how do they work together?</li>
<li>How can we provide great service to users all around the planet?</li>
</ul>
<p>Things you might expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long gone are the days when everything you design could easily fit onto a single machine. You may be given a large data set to work with. You need to explain how it can be sharded among multiple worker machines.</li>
<li>You may be presented with a request which can be answered by any one of a pool of machines and you need to identify the fastest machine and discard the rest.</li>
<li>You should also be prepared to discuss system component properties such as latency, throughput, and storage. The interviewer would want to see numeric estimates for these properties, such as how many requests per second the system can handle. Also, be prepared to provide a clear justification of how the design backs up these numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should know industry solution patterns like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharding Data</li>
<li>Replication Types</li>
<li>Write-ahead Logging</li>
<li>Separating Data and Metadata Storage</li>
<li>Basic Kinds of Load Distribution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trade-offs-and-compromises">Trade-offs and Compromises<a href="#trade-offs-and-compromises" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>As a systems designer at Google, you will have to make trade-offs and compromises.</p>
<p>The interviewer may ask you to identify systematic shortcomings and describe how the system responds to various failures. You are expected to lay out the trade-offs and compromises you made and explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>Example: Do you store data on a rotating disk and pay less money for the storage at the cost of increased latency? Or do you put the data on a flash drive where you&rsquo;re able to retrieve it quickly but pay more money?</p>
<p>Google looks for systems designers that can consider multiple solutions, commit to one, and then iterate on it.</p>
<p>Now that you have the focus areas, here are some overall best practices to keep in mind for your actual interview day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain: The interviewer wants to understand how you think, so it is important to explain your thought process during the interview. They are not only evaluating your technical ability but also how you solve problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an engineer, we like to solve hard problems and jump into the final design; however, this approach is likely to lead you to design the wrong system.</p>
<p>In system design interviews, it&rsquo;s crucial to establish a shared understanding with the interviewer before progressing through each phase. Here&rsquo;s a structured approach to achieve this:
Try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore All Alternatives: Before settling on a design choice, consider various options. Discuss these alternatives with the interviewer to evaluate their feasibility and relevance.</li>
<li>Confirm Assumptions:
<ul>
<li>Explicitly State Assumptions: Clearly articulate any assumptions you are making about the system&rsquo;s behavior or constraints.</li>
<li>Seek Validation: Present these assumptions to the interviewer and ask for confirmation to ensure alignment. For example, you might say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming the system needs to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users; does that align with your expectations?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obtain Clear Approval Before Proceeding:
<ul>
<li>Summarize Key Points: After discussing requirements and assumptions, recap the main decisions and understandings (?)</li>
<li>Seek a Green Light: Ask the interviewer directly if they&rsquo;re comfortable with the discussed approach before moving to the next step. This could be phrased as, &ldquo;Is there anything else we should consider, or are we ready to proceed with this design direction?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understand-the-problem-and-establish-design-scope">Understand the problem and establish design scope<a href="#understand-the-problem-and-establish-design-scope" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions. Define Feature Expectations</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like algorithm design, system design questions will also most likely be weakly defined. So we need gather requirements and scope the problem. You have to get a sense for the scope of the problem before you start exploring the space of possible solutions.</p>
<p>So how do you figure out what type of service the interviewer wants you to build? Ask them! A basic prompt leaves room for you to start a conversation with your interviewer about the system you&rsquo;re designing—what type of users does it serve, what type of traffic can it expect, what limits will it have? Demonstrating that you can think critically about the parameters of your service is the first step in any system design interview.</p>
<p>What you need to collect and define:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional Requirements. May be in form of User Stories or Use Cases.</li>
<li>Scenarios that will not be covered and Edge Cases</li>
<li>API</li>
<li>Design Goals in form of Architectural Characteristics (Non-Functional requirements). It may be such as: number of current and future users and others. Latency and Throughput requirements. Consistency vs Availability  [Weak/strong/eventual =&gt; consistency | Failover/replication =&gt; availability]. Question: what parts of my system are absolutely critical? And what parts of my system would be ok to fail?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions:
SLA numbers;
volume of the system: number of users,
time/flow/peaks: number of current users, peaks
data distribution</p>
<h3 id="user-stories-use-cases">User stories, use cases<a href="#user-stories-use-cases" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>The very first thing you should do with any system design question is to clarify the system&rsquo;s constraints and to identify what use cases the system needs to satisfy. Spend a few minutes questioning your interviewer and agreeing on the scope of the system. Many of the same rules we discussed while talking about algorithm design apply here as well.</p>
<p>Usually, part of what the interviewer wants to see is if you can gather the requirements about the problem at hand, and design a solution that covers them well.</p>
<p>Never assume things that were not explicitly stated.</p>
<p>For example, the URL-shortening service could be meant to serve just a few thousand users, but each could be sharing millions of URLs. It could be meant to handle millions of clicks on the shortened URLs, or dozens. The service may have to provide extensive statistics about each shortened URL (which will increase your data size), or statistics may not be a requirement at all.</p>
<p>You will also have to think about the use cases that are expected to occur. Your system will be designed based on what it&rsquo;s expected to do. Don&rsquo;t forget to make sure you know all the requirements the interviewer didn&rsquo;t tell you about in the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="ask-questions-to-clarify-use-cases-and-constraints">Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints<a href="#ask-questions-to-clarify-use-cases-and-constraints" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Do you know the constraints? What kind of inputs does your system need to handle? Discuss assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is going to use it? How are they going to use it? How many users are there? What does the system do? What are the inputs and outputs of the system? How much data do we expect to handle? How many requests per second do we expect? What is the expected read to write ratio?</li>
<li>How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year? What is the company&rsquo;s technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="define-api">Define API<a href="#define-api" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Define what APIs are expected from the system. This would not only establish the exact contract expected from the system but would also ensure if you haven&rsquo;t gotten any requirements wrong. Some examples for our Twitter-like service would be:
<code>postTweet(user_id, tweet_text, image_url, user_location, timestamp, …) generateTimeline(user_id, current_time) recordUserTweetLike(user_id, tweet_id, timestamp, …)</code>
If you have gathered the requirements and can identify the APIs exposed by the system, you are 50% done.</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-data-model">Defining the Data Model<a href="#defining-the-data-model" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Defining the data model early will clarify how data will flow among different components of the system. Later, it will guide you towards better data partitioning and management. Candidate should be able to identify various entities of the system, how they will interact with each other and different aspect of data management like storage, transfer, encryption, etc. Here are some entities for our Twitter-like service:</p>
<p><code>User: UserID, Name, Email, DoB, CreationData, LastLogin, etc. Tweet: TweetID, Content, TweetLocation, NumberOfLikes, TimeStamp, etc. UserFollows: UserdID1, UserID2 FavoriteTweets: UserID, TweetID, TimeStamp</code></p>
<p>OUTPUT: ???</p>
<h2 id="create-a-high-level-design">Create a High Level Design<a href="#create-a-high-level-design" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>Which database system should we use? Would NoSQL like Cassandra best fits our needs, or we should use MySQL-like solution. What kind of blob storage should we use to store photos and videos?</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve scoped the system you&rsquo;re about to design, you should continue by outlining a high-level abstract design. The goal of this is to outline all the important components that your architecture will need.</p>
<p>It is a great idea to collaborate with the interviewer during the process: come up with an initial blueprint for the design. Ask for feedback. Treat your interviewer as a teammate and work together. Many good interviewers love to talk and get involved.</p>
<p>Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper. This might include clients (mobile/web), APIs, web servers, data stores, cache, CDN, message queue, etc.
High Level Design may express the brief functionality of each module in a form of a Usage Scenarios with functional flow. &lt;&ndash; Define this in a form of a Diagram</p>
<p>Get through main Use Cases.</p>
<p>You can tell the interviewer that you would like to do that and draw a simple diagram of your ideas. Sketch your main components and the connections between them. If you do this, very quickly you will be able to get feedback if you are moving in the right direction. Of course, you must be able to justify the high-level design that you just drew.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get lured to dive deep into some particular aspect of the abstract design. Not yet. Rather, make sure you sketch the important components and the connections between them. Justify your ideas in front of the interviewer and try to address every constraint and use case.</p>
<p>Usually, this sort of high-level design is a combination of well-known techniques, which people have developed. You have to make sure you are familiar with what&rsquo;s out there and feel comfortable using this knowledge. In this chapter we will assume that you have enough experience to design such a high-level system. Our goal is to focus more on the next steps, where we will talk mainly about scalability and about removing bottlenecks.</p>
<p>If possible, go through a few concrete use cases. This will help you frame the high-level design. It is also likely that the use cases would help you discover edge cases you have not yet considered.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>APIs for Read/Write scenarios for crucial components. Should we include API endpoints and database schema here? This depends on the problem. For large design problems like &ldquo;Design Google search engine&rdquo;, this is a bit of too low level. For a problem like designing the backend for a multi-player poker game, this is a fair game. Communicate with your interviewer.</li>

<li>Amount of data you want to store in disk/SSD</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Flag</em>: an agreement with the interviewer on the design.</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<h2 id="design-deep-dive">Design deep dive<a href="#design-deep-dive" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>At this step, you and your interviewer should have already achieved the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreed on the overall goals and feature scope</li>
<li>Sketched out a high-level blueprint for the overall design</li>
<li>Obtained feedback from your interviewer on the high-level design</li>
<li>Had some initial ideas about areas to focus on in deep dive based on her feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>You shall work with the interviewer to identify and prioritize components in the architecture. It is worth stressing that every interview is different. Sometimes, the interviewer may give off hints that she likes focusing on high-level design. Sometimes, for a senior candidate interview, the discussion could be on the system performance characteristics, likely focusing on the bottlenecks and resource estimations. In most cases, the interviewer may want you to dig into details of some system components. For URL shortener, it is interesting to dive into the hash function design that converts a long URL to a short one. For a chat system, how to reduce latency and how to support online/offline status are two interesting topics.</p>
<p>Time management is essential as it is easy to get carried away with minute details that do not demonstrate your abilities. You must be armed with signals to show your interviewer. Try not to get into unnecessary details. For example, talking about the EdgeRank algorithm of Facebook feed ranking in detail is not ideal during a system design interview as this takes much precious time and does not prove your ability in designing a scalable system.</p>
<p>Dig deeper into 2–3 components; interviewer&rsquo;s feedback should always guide you towards which parts of the system she wants you to explain further. You should be able to provide different approaches, their pros and cons, and why would you choose one? Remember there is no single answer, the only thing important is to <em>consider</em> <em>tradeoffs</em> between different options while keeping system constraints in mind. e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Since we&rsquo;ll be storing a huge amount of data, how should we partition our data to distribute it to multiple databases? Should we try to store all the data of a user on the same database? What issues can it cause?</li>
<li>How would we handle high-traffic users e.g. celebrities who have millions of followers?</li>
<li>Since user&rsquo;s timeline will contain the most recent (and relevant) tweets, should we try to store our data in a way that is optimized to scan latest tweets?</li>
<li>How much and at which layer should we introduce cache to speed things up?</li>
<li>What components need better load balancing?</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if you were asked to design a url shortening service, discuss: Generating and storing a hash of the full url, MD5 and Base62, Hash collisions, SQL or NoSQL, Database schema, Translating a hashed url to the full url, Database lookup, API and object-oriented design</p>
<h3 id="low-level-design">Low Level Design<a href="#low-level-design" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Low-level design fills in some of the gaps to provide extra detail that&rsquo;s necessary before developers can start writing code. It gives more specific guidance for how the parts of the system will work and how they will work together. It refines the definitions of the database, the major classes, and the internal and external interfaces.</p>
<p><em>Expectations from the candidates</em>
In the LLD Interviews, they will judge you on your knowledge of creating ==modular, flexible, maintainable and reusable software==(this is common architectural characteristics of system under design), by applying [patterns, principles, tools etc].</p>
<p>Usually LLD talks about the class diagrams with the methods and relations between classes, program specs and other low level details for a given system. It is also known as Object Oriented Design (OOD).</p>
<p>Machine coding and class diagrams do come under LLD. Most interviewers aren&rsquo;t super interested in the exactness of UML notations. They want to see a general understanding of the class structure and how you design APIs.</p>
<p>Low Level Design expresses details functional logic of the module.</p>
<p><em>How to solve LLD problems in the Interview</em>
12.  Clarify the problem by asking the relevant questions. Gather the complete requirement and start with the basic features.
13.  Define the Core Classes ( and Objects )
14.  Establish the relationships between the classes / objects by observing the interactions among the classes / objects.
15.  Try to fulfill all the requirements by defining the methods
16.  Apply [Object Oriented, Functional etc.] Design Principles and use Design Patterns and other tools to make the system maintainable and reusable.
17.  Write well structured clean code (if you are told to implement a function)</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up<a href="#wrap-up" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>In this final step, the interviewer might ask you a few follow-up questions or give you the freedom to discuss other additional points. Here are a few directions to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interviewer might want you to identify the system bottlenecks and discuss potential improvements. Never say your design is perfect and nothing can be improved. There is always something to improve upon. This is a great opportunity to show your critical thinking and leave a good final impression.</li>
<li>It could be useful to give the interviewer a recap of your design. This is particularly important if you suggested a few solutions. Refreshing your interviewer&rsquo;s memory can be helpful after a long session.</li>
<li>Error cases (server failure, network loss, etc.) are interesting to talk about.</li>
<li>Operation issues are worth mentioning. How do you monitor metrics and error logs? How to roll out the system?</li>
<li>How to handle the next scale curve is also an interesting topic. For example, if your current design supports 1 million users, what changes do you need to make to support 10 million users?</li>
<li>Propose other refinements you need if you had more time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identifying-and-resolving-bottlenecks">Identifying and resolving bottlenecks<a href="#identifying-and-resolving-bottlenecks" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Most likely your high-level design will have one or more bottlenecks given the constraints of the problem. This is perfectly ok. You are not expected to design a system from the ground up, which immediately handles all the load in the world. It just needs to be scalable, in order for you to be able to improve it using some standard tools and techniques.</p>
<p>Try to discuss as many bottlenecks as possible and different approaches to mitigate them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there any single point of failure in our system? What are we doing to mitigate it?</li>
<li>Do we&rsquo;ve enough replicas of the data so that if we lose a few servers, we can still serve our users?</li>
<li>Similarly, do we&rsquo;ve enough copies of different services running, such that a few failures will not cause total system shutdown?</li>
<li>How are we monitoring the performance of our service? Do we get alerts whenever critical components fail or their performance degrades?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How to deal with ambiguity? What questions should you ask? Is there a some framework?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether this is an algorithmic problem or system design problem, it always makes sense to start with (or at least mention to the interviewer) a simple solution and evolve the solution along the interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companies widely adopt system design interviews because the communication and problem solving skills tested in these interviews are similar to those required by a software engineer&rsquo;s daily work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system design interview simulates real-life problem solving where two co-workers collaborate on an ambiguous problem and come up with a solution that meets their goals. The problem is open-ended, and there is no perfect answer. The final design is less important compared <em>to the work</em> you put in the <em>design process</em>. This allows you to demonstrate your design skill, defend your design choices, and respond to feedback in a constructive manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system design interview is an open-ended conversation. You are expected to lead it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many think that system design interview is all about a person&rsquo;s technical design skills. It is much more than that. An effective system design interview gives strong signals about a person&rsquo;s ability to collaborate, to work under pressure, and to resolve ambiguity constructively. The ability to ask good questions is also an essential skill, and many interviewers specifically look for this skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A core aim of a systems design interview is to give the candidate an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your background to your advantage. Your experience and background can vary widely from the next candidate. You bring a set of values and expertise to the table that no one else can. That is what makes you valuable and irreplaceable. Regardless of what field you&rsquo;re in, people care about what you can bring to the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on thought process. What we actually care about is the thought process behind your design choices. This reflects what actually working at Palantir is like. As engineers we have a tremendous amount of freedom. We aren&rsquo;t asked to implement fully-specced features. Instead we take ownership of open-ended problems, and it&rsquo;s our job to come up with the best solution to each. (Delegation). We need people we can trust to do the right thing without a lot of supervision—people who can own large projects and take them consistently in the right direction. Invariably, this means being able to communicate effectively with the people around you. Working on problems with huge scope isn&rsquo;t something you can do in a vacuum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that there is no one right answer. A system can be built in different ways. The important thing is to be able to justify your ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen good candidates fail not because they lack the knowledge but because they cannot focus on the right things while discussing a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factor: Your ability to articulate your thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterative nature of design: when designing your system, these are the kind of calculations you should be doing over and over in your head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In short, due to the unstructured nature of software design interviews, candidates who are organized with a clear plan to attack the problem have better chances of success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, Google divides its system design into different sections: Web Development, Distributed Systems, Machine learning, Mobile Development, Database Design</p>

<h2 id="clarifying-questions">Clarifying questions<a href="#clarifying-questions" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>One of the most useful strategies I personally employ is to ask clarification questions. What are &ldquo;good&rdquo; clarification questions, you ask?</p>
<p>A good clarification question helps you achieve one, or more, of several things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Helps you narrow the scope of what you&rsquo;re supposed to do</li>
<li>Helps clarify what the user expectation of the system is</li>
<li>Gives you direction about where to proceed</li>
<li>Informs you of possible bottlenecks/problem areas</li>
</ol>
<p>In the black box example, you might ask, &ldquo;well, what does the box hold? How many items does it hold? And who is the intended user?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="handle-murphys-law">Handle Murphy&rsquo;s law<a href="#handle-murphys-law" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>This is something that most people skip but this is one of the most important things that you must cover which talks about how resilient your system is. In the real world, things break, and when they do, you need to make sure you are in full control of your system.</p>
<p>Talk about how you monitor the system. What kind of alerting mechanism do you have in place? What are your KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and how do you track them? What happens when things break, when your service crashes, your DB&rsquo;s master node goes down or even when one of your datacentres goes down?
Again, if you haven&rsquo;t done this before, see how I have been doing it, towards the later half of this video.</p>
<p>Now that you have your high-level design, start thinking about what bottlenecks it has. Perhaps your system needs a load balancer and many machines behind it to handle the user requests. Or maybe the data is so huge that you need to distribute your database on multiple machines. What are some of the downsides that occur from doing that? Is the database too slow and does it need some in-memory caching?</p>
<p>These are just examples of questions that you may have to answer in order to make your solution complete. It may be the case that the interviewer wants to direct the discussion in one particular direction. Then, maybe you won&rsquo;t need to address all the bottlenecks but rather talk in more depth about one particular area. In any case, you need to be able to identify the weak spots in a system and be able to resolve them.</p>
<h2 id="scale-the-design">Scale the design<a href="#scale-the-design" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>

<ul>
<li>Load balancer</li>
<li>Horizontal scaling</li>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>Database sharding</li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs. Everything is a trade-off. Address bottlenecks using principles of scalable system design.</p>
<p>Estimation. Estimation, especially in the form of a back-of-the-envelope calculation, is important because it helps you narrow down the list of possible solutions to only the ones that are feasible. Then you have only a few prototypes or micro-benchmarks to write.</p>

<p>First. Single server setup. To start with something simple, everything is running on a single server. Figure 1-1 shows the illustration of a single server setup where everything is running on one server: web-app, database, cache, etc.
To understand this setup, it is helpful to investigate the request flow and traffic source.
For this, we need to move state (for instance user session data) out of the web tier. A good practice is to store session data in the persistent storage such as relational database or NoSQL. Each web server in the cluster can access state data from databases. This is called stateless web tier. Several technical challenges must be resolved to achieve multi-data center setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join and de-normalization: Once a database has been sharded across multiple servers, it is hard to perform join operations across database shards. A common workaround is to denormalize the database so that queries can be performed in a single table.</li>

<p>🔹 What It Is:<br>
Start with the simplest functional solution and iterate based on constraints and scale.</p>
<p>How to Apply It:<br>
1️. Design a basic working system first (e.g., a monolith instead of microservices).<br>
2️. Add complexity only when justified (e.g., introduce sharding when a single database becomes a bottleneck).<br>
3️. Iterate based on trade-offs and scalability needs.</p>
<p>Why It Works:<br>
✔ Keeps the discussion structured and iterative.<br>
✔ Prevents over-engineering too early.</p>
<p>^^ also maybe we can say like: ok, we have several scenatios for the future. One most probable of them is night-spikes of users. So one of the qualities of one subsystem is to hold this kind of load.

<p>🔹 What It Is:
Identify and eliminate bottlenecks first, instead of prematurely optimizing.</p>
<p>🔹 How to Apply It:
1️⃣ Ask where the biggest bottleneck is. &lt;- Maybe here we can find out most critical bottleneck for users? Future x critical bottlenecks? How we can change the design in the future to prevent this bottlenecks? Proactive</p>
<p>CPU-bound? (Compute-heavy tasks need parallelization)
I/O-bound? (Disk reads/writes need caching or distributed databases)
Network-bound? (Latency needs CDNs and efficient protocols)
2️⃣ Prioritize optimizations that give the biggest gain.
🔹 Example:
Q: &ldquo;How would you handle millions of search queries per second in an e-commerce app?&rdquo;
A (Bottleneck-First Approach):</p>
<p>Bottleneck 1: Full-text search in databases → Introduce Elasticsearch or Solr.
Bottleneck 2: High read traffic → Use Redis for caching popular searches.
Bottleneck 3: High latency due to database queries → Precompute trending results to reduce load.
🔹 Why It Works:
✔ Focuses on real bottlenecks instead of premature optimization.
✔ Makes the solution more efficient incrementally.</p>

<h1 id="core-principles-of-optimizing-systems-under-design">Core Principles of Optimizing Systems Under Design</h1>
<p>In a system design interview, optimization is not just about improving performance—it&rsquo;s about making informed trade-offs, balancing scalability, cost, reliability, and maintainability, while demonstrating a structured thought process.</p>
<p>🔹 1. Keep it Simple, then Optimize – Start with a functional design, optimize as scale grows.
🔹 2. Measure Before Optimizing – Profile performance first using real metrics.
🔹 3. Balance Trade-offs – No system is 100% scalable, consistent, and cost-effective at the same time.
🔹 4. Optimize the Right Bottlenecks – Don&rsquo;t waste effort on optimizations with little impact.
🔹 5. Design for Failure – Build resilient systems that degrade gracefully.
🔹 6. Think in Layers – Optimize frontend, backend, database, and network layers systematically.
🔹 7. Automate Scaling – Use auto-scaling and self-healing mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="trade-off-triangle">Trade-Off Triangle<a href="#trade-off-triangle" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>The Trade-Off Triangle (CAP Theorem + Scalability vs. Consistency vs. Cost)
🔹 What It Is:
Every system design decision trades off between three key constraints:</p>
<p>Scalability (Can the system handle increased load?)
Consistency (Does every user see the latest data immediately?)
Cost &amp; Complexity (How expensive is it to maintain?)
🔹 How to Apply It:</p>
<p>Scaling reads? Use caching or read replicas.
Scaling writes? Consider partitioning or sharding.
Need strong consistency? Accept limited availability in network failures (CP system in CAP theorem).
🔹 Example:
Q: &ldquo;How would you design a global social media feed?&rdquo;
A (Applying Trade-offs):
1️⃣ If low latency is key → Choose eventual consistency (AP system, with caching).
2️⃣ If real-time accuracy is key → Choose strong consistency (CP system, but sacrifice speed).
3️⃣ Hybrid Approach: Prioritize eventual consistency for most users, but strong consistency for VIP users or trending posts.</p>
<p>🔹 Why It Works:
✔ Shows awareness of real-world constraints.
✔ Justifies design choices with clear reasoning.</p>
