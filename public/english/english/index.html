<h1 id="discourse-markers">Discourse Markers</h1>
<p>A discourse marker is a word or a phrase that plays a role in <strong>managing the flow and structure of discourse</strong>.</p>
<p>Common discourse markers used in the English language include &ldquo;you know&rdquo;, &ldquo;actually&rdquo;, &ldquo;basically&rdquo;, &ldquo;like&rdquo;, &ldquo;I mean&rdquo;, &ldquo;okay&rdquo; and &ldquo;so&rdquo;. Data shows that discourse markers often come from different word classes, such as adverbs (&ldquo;well&rdquo;) or prepositional phrases (&ldquo;in fact&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Yael Maschler divided discourse markers into four broad categories: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_communication" title="Interpersonal communication">interpersonal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_function" title="Referential function">referential</a>, structural, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognitive</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of sentences and English grammar structures:</p>
<p>PureScript is similar to Haskell in syntax and usage and should be fairly easy to get started with, now <em>that</em> you’ve completed this book.</p>
<p>Everything works fine, but it’d be much easier to work with if this code was broken up a bit.</p>
<p>If <em>we happen to</em> make a request for the same payment twice, we are going to get a specific HTTP response code containing the Payment Id.</p>
<p>The latter is not appropriate for linked lists, but of course Get and Set make a lot of sense for arrays.</p>
<p>The drawback is that those data structures give you no control over the order in which the elements appear.</p>
<p>A well-known data structure for finding objects quickly is the hash table.</p>
<p>A hash code is somehow derived from the instance fields of an object, preferably in such a way that objects with different data yield different codes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important for now is that hash codes can be computed quickly and that the computation depends only on the state of the object that needs to be hashed, not on the other objects in the hash table.</p>
<p>If you know how many elements, approximately, will eventually be in the table, you can set the bucket count.</p>
<p>Some researchers believe that it is a good idea to make the bucket count a prime number to prevent a clustering of keys.</p>
<p>The priority queue makes use of and elegant and efficient data structure called a heap.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the collection interfaces come in.</p>
<p>We like the algorithms because they make life easier for the programmer reading the code.</p>
<p>If you write your own algorithm (or, in fact, any method that has a collection as a parameter), you should work with interfaces, not concrete implementations, whenever possible.</p>
<p>The reason is simply timing.</p>
<p>When using the new aggregate operations and lambda expressions, you must take care to avoid mutation so as not to introduce problems in the future, should your code be run later from a parallel stream.</p>
<p>The add operation runs in amortized constant time, that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time.</p>
<p>In particular, some lists will refuse to add null elements, and others will impose restrictions on the type of elements that may be added.</p>
<p>*Administrator has an option to preview those members who match the specified criteria before he or she specifies the action to be performed or before selecting the Submit button.</p>
<p>Thrown to indicate that the code has attempted to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance.</p>
<p>The Android SDK and Testing Support Library include tools and APIs for setting up and running test apps within an emulator or on the device you are targeting.</p>
<p>The add operation runs in amortized constant time, <em>that is</em>, adding n elements requires O(n) time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now to make the buttons fully armed and operational.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each activity is given a window in which to draw its user interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your subclass, you need to implement callback methods that the system calls when the activity transitions between various states of its lifecycle, such as when the activity is being created, stopped, resumed, or destroyed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>160129</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is usually where you should commit any changes that should be persisted beyond the current user session (because the user might not come back).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several other lifecycle callback methods that you should use in order to provide a fluid user experience between activities and handle unexpected interruptions that cause your activity to be stopped and even destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must declare your activity in the manifest file in order for it to be accessible to the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, when the activity is paused, so are all fragments in it, and when the activity is destroyed, so are all fragments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system calls this method as the first indication that the user is leaving the fragment (though it does not always mean the fragment is being destroyed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have two options when it comes to hosting a UI fragment in an activity:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional identefier of the container this fragment is to be placed in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve tried that, and I&rsquo;ll go over that in a moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed.</p>

<li>
<p>The class diagram is not only widely used but also subject to the greatest range of modeling concepts.</p>

<p>Creating custom layout and scrolling behavior with a RV is still a lot of work, bur RV was built to be extended, so it is not quite so bad.</p>
<p>This tool allows for objects to be shared as singletons, while still making it possible to replace them when needed.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was a mistranslation from Sw, and actor is the term the use case community uses.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don&rsquo;t yet have in your repository, you can run git fetch pb:</p>

<p>The actual number of milliseconds that the thread sleeps is subject to the presiciton and accuracy of system timers and shedulers.</p>
<p>However, this support comes at the price of increased complexity.</p>
<p>When a thread attempts to acquire a lock that it&rsquo;s already holding, thre request succeeds.</p>

<p>The area that only the kernel can access is called kernel space.</p>

<p>Since our ls command generated no results and only error message, the redirection operation started to rewrite the file and then stopped because of the error, resulting in its truncation.</p>
<p>Using the pipe operator &lsquo;|&rsquo;, the standart output of one command can be piped into the standart input of another.</p>

<p>I asked to write this foreword so that I could explain why.</p>
<p>Who am I to claim knowledge of editor usage? Well at Floobits[1] we&rsquo;ve made plugins for Sublime Text, Vim, Emacs, and IntelliJ. We can see how many people download and use each one. Sublime Text and IntelliJ are by far the most popular editors. It could be that Emacs and Vim users really don&rsquo;t like to collaborate, but it seems more likely that simply fewer people use them.</p>

<p>However these functional elements don&rsquo;t constitute the main focus of the way programs are structured and designed in Java.</p>
<p>and shielding app developers from unimportant implementation details that are likely to change over time.</p>
<p>In particular, abstraction helps developers focus on what their apps are doing to meet the requirements rather than being distracted by lower level implementation details of how their apps work in a given operating environment.</p>

<p>It is comprised of three parts, of which Part 1 introduces programming on the basis of familiar concepts, like calculators and games.</p>
<p>So the first challenge is figuring out exactly what we want our program to do.</p>
<p>161031</p>
<p>but there are many other useful category of JVM parameters which you at least like to be familiar even if not intending to use it more frequently.</p>
<p>The role of the JVM is to read the Java application through the Class Loader and execute it along with the Java API.</p>
<p>All types (class and interface) except for primitive data types are referred to through symbolic reference, instead of through explicit memory address-based reference.</p>
<p>161101</p>
<p>Understanding bytecode and what bytecode is likely to be generated by a Java compiler helps the Java programmer</p>
<p>but often people recruiting are looking for someone who knows how to fix a problem like a memory leak when it happens.</p>
<p>It is surprising, and sobering, to discover how complicated seemingly simple concepts like synchronization really are.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/42tqul/i_left_a_snarky_note_in_the_glovebox_of_my_honda/">mfiasco</a> was tired of getting his car stolen.</p>
<p>· The orientation of this book is to study <em>algorithms likely to be of</em> practical use.</p>
<p>· Each chapter has a detailed description of applications where <em>the algorithms described</em> play a critical role.</p>
<p>· Our primary goal is to introduce the most importrant algorithms <em>in use today</em> to as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<p>· Applications are drawn from introductory material in the sciences, again self-contained.</p>
<p>· There will soon come a day when Objective C <em>is used by nobody</em> to develop apps.</p>
<p>· It <em>would be</em> worth your while to talk to the editor.</p>
<p>· That year whiled for me.</p>
<p>· It was an easy task for an expert, while it was dangerous for a novice.</p>
<p>· In this section, we will consider the first five of these <em>in turn</em>.</p>
<p>· This rule highlight the idea that we are often working with approximate values, since it is often the case <em>that the exact value that would seem to be defined by the expression is not a value of the type</em>.</p>
<p>· The main reason that people study algorithms, <em>is to be able</em> to solve problems that it could not otherwise be addressed.</p>
<p>· An algorithm must be seen to be believed. <em>I believe so.</em> Jane <em>believes in eating carefully</em> to control her weight.</p>
<p>· So, for this course we have two resources <em>that I want to talk about</em> and make sure <em>that people are familiar with before entering</em> into the content.</p>
<p>· So, what we do is try to figure out why, find a way to address whatever&rsquo;s causing that problem, find a new algorithm and iterate until we&rsquo;re satisfied.</p>
<p>·  And then as long as standard input is not empty, it&rsquo;s going to read two integers from the input.</p>

<p>Imagine that you take your car <em>to be repaired</em>. The mechanic <em>you talk to</em> doesn&rsquo;t seem to know the names of the parts of the car. He keeps referring to &ldquo;the round things&rdquo; or &ldquo;the part that makes the car go.&rdquo; You probably wouldn&rsquo;t think the mechanic knew his job well.</p>

<p>I feel there is a need of a more extensive presentation of mixed conditional sentences and an attempt at their classifi cation may be a small step forward.</p>
<p>As in many other languages, it is only the counterfactual type that causes the conditional mood to be used.</p>

<p>40d</p>
<p><strong>Would</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;Would&rsquo; has quite a lot of different uses. It&rsquo;s often a kind of past tense version of &lsquo;will&rsquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>The past of &lsquo;will&rsquo; in reported speech</li>
<li>Willingness in the past</li>
</ul>
<p>In the present we use &lsquo;will&rsquo; to talk about willingness (willingness means that you are happy to do something). For example, if we say &lsquo;I will help you&rsquo;, this means &lsquo;I&rsquo;m offering to help you&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m happy to help you&rsquo;. We use &lsquo;would&rsquo; for the same meaning in the past. Usually, we use this in the negative (when we are not happy to do something) and we use &lsquo;won&rsquo;t&rsquo; for the present and &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t for the past&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The Modal Auxiliary + Have + Past Participle type construction (Modal Auxiliary + Perfect) allows us to speak retrospectively about a completed action in the past:</p>
<p>We use <strong>would have</strong> (<strong>done</strong>) when we imagine something that didn&rsquo;t happen in the past</p>
<p>They helped us a lot. I don&rsquo;t know what we <strong>&rsquo;d have done</strong> without their help.</p>

<p><strong>Conditionals</strong></p>
<p>The first conditional has the <a href="https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-simple.html">present simple</a> after &lsquo;if&rsquo;, then the <a href="https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/simple-future.html">future simple</a> in the other clause</p>
<p>If I study today, I&rsquo;ll go to the party tonight.</p>
<p>The <strong>second conditional</strong> describes an imaginary, impossible or unlikely situation in the present or future. The past tense is indicating a distance from reality. It`s not indicating a time.</p>
<p>If I had a lot of money, I would buy an expensive car. (The situation is hypothetical.)</p>
<p>He would call her if he knew her telephone.</p>
<p>If you played tennis together, he would win. (It<code>s unlikely you will play tennis together. But I</code>m certaing that he would win.)</p>
<p>If you played tennis together, he might/could win.</p>
<p>#If he were speaking, you would not be allowed to interrupt like that.</p>
<p>The <strong>third conditional</strong> describes hypothetical situations in the past. We are imagining the results of something that did not happen. We&rsquo;re imagining the different past.</p>
<p>(Yesterday, you played the lottery. But you did not win).</p>
<p>If I had won the lottery, I would have bought a house.</p>

<p><strong>Absolute participle construction (<strong>Absolute constructions consist of a noun and some kind of modifier, the most common being a participle. Because they often come at the beginning of a sentence, they are easily confused with dangling participles. But an absolute construction modifies the rest of the sentence, not the subject of the sentence (as a participial phrase does).</strong>)</strong></p>
