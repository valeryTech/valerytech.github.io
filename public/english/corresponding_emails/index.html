<p>Displaying a polished appearance through your email ending will help solidify a positive impression and ensure recipients understand you take pride in how you present yourself in professional situations. By implementing these tips and using these examples to help craft your email ending, you can make sure your email message reflects your competence, attention to detail and professionalism.</p>
<p>When accepting a job offer:
&ldquo;Hi there Kiran,
Thank you so much for getting back to me. I&rsquo;m excited to learn about the offer…&rdquo;</p>
<p>== == ==</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-letter">Thank you letter<a href="#thank-you-letter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start with a salutation
Begin your message with a salutation like &ldquo;Dear Candace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hello, Candace.&rdquo; After the greeting, explain why you&rsquo;re writing and include an expression of gratitude.
Example: &ldquo;Dear Candace,
Thank you so much for taking the time to visit our office yesterday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share your gratitude with specifics
Although you likely shared why you want to establish a relationship during your initial conversation, it&rsquo;s helpful to reiterate your enthusiasm. This shows the recipient you&rsquo;re serious about developing a working relationship and want to continue communication.
Example: &ldquo;We are thrilled at the prospect of working more with you all on projects in the future, and we hope to learn more about process efficiency from you as we grow.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include any details from conversations
Sharing details from your interactions with the thank you note recipient demonstrates active listening skills and conveys interest. It can also help a new contact remember you. This is helpful if the recipient talked with several people in a short period, such as if you&rsquo;re sending a thank you note to someone you met during a conference or trade show.
Take a few moments to jot down some notes as soon as the conversation is over. This way, you won&rsquo;t forget any meaningful aspects of the discussion.
Example: &ldquo;Learning about how your team is working to resolve our scheduling issues was immensely helpful, as we plan on working with more clients in the new year.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close with additional thoughts or info
If there are any key takeaways or next steps, include them in your closing statement. Remember, keeping it brief but impactful is the best way to ensure it is read completely.
Example: &ldquo;We wish you safe travels as you head home and will follow up about our action items early next week.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End with a polite signoff
Finally, end your thank you note with a signoff, such as &ldquo;Thanks again,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sincerely,&rdquo; and a professional signature.
Take a few minutes to review your thank you notes for any spelling, grammar or syntax mistakes. A message that&rsquo;s free from errors shows you&rsquo;re professional and detail-oriented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="follow-up">Follow up<a href="#follow-up" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard back from a potential employer after your interview or after your post-interview follow-up, you can send a &ldquo;checking in&rdquo; email, ideally to the recruiter. You should send this email if you haven&rsquo;t heard back after two weeks since your interview.
Keep it concise. Indicate that you&rsquo;re looking for more information without being overeager:
•	In the subject line, include the job title you interviewed for.
•	Send this email to the recruiter. They are the most likely to be up-to-date on what&rsquo;s going on in the hiring process.
•	Keep it to one paragraph, indicating that you are still interested in the job and looking for an update. Offer to provide additional information if they need it. Sign off with a thank you.
Subject line: Checking in RE: marketing coordinator role
Dear Yesenia,
I hope you&rsquo;re well! I&rsquo;m checking in on the marketing coordinator role. It was great to meet with the team earlier and I&rsquo;m looking forward to your update. Please let me know if there&rsquo;s anything else I can provide to assist in the decision-making process.
Thank you,

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to worry that checking in makes you seem desperate or annoying. The truth is that these decisions take a different amount of time at each company. You&rsquo;re simply giving them a gentle nudge for an update. And, if you really want the job, there&rsquo;s no harm in reiterating that.</p>
<h2 id="staying-in-touch-email">Staying-in-touch email<a href="#staying-in-touch-email" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>If you still haven&rsquo;t heard back after checking in or you&rsquo;ve learned that you didn&rsquo;t get the job, you can still venture to stay in touch with the hiring manager. The goal of this follow-up email is to establish a professional relationship with a person who can help you grow.
Just like your checking-in email, this follow-up is short:
•	Send this email to the hiring manager. This person is probably at a senior level and could be a potential mentor if you&rsquo;re looking to grow in this field.
•	In your first paragraph, mention what about them you found interesting or inspirational.
•	Limit to two paragraphs and include a proposed timeframe for a phone call or coffee meeting.</p>
<p>Subject line: Staying in touch
Dear Robert,
Hope you&rsquo;re well. I&rsquo;m reaching out to say thank you again for your time and consideration. I sincerely enjoyed my conversations with you and others at ABC Inc. In particular, I found the details you shared of your own career path very inspirational. As someone who&rsquo;s aspiring to build my career in manufacturing, I&rsquo;d love to learn more about how you&rsquo;ve developed and applied your skills.
I know you&rsquo;re busy, but if you have 20 minutes to spare, it would be great to get on your calendar. Are you available for a phone or coffee chat sometime in the next few weeks?
Thanks again,
Henry Ramirez

<p>Be aware that if you received a firm &ldquo;no&rdquo; on this job, it is highly unlikely that this email will change that. What it can do, however, is reinforce your interest in the company and indicate to the hiring manager that even though you may not have been the right fit for this job, there may be a future role for which you are well suited.</p>

<li>
<p>I hope you …
Email content starting with good wishes are always a great way of being social and friendly. Remember that socializing is vital in the business world, and you don&rsquo;t need to be so formal all the time. However, always be respectful and think twice before bringing to the table things that can sound offensive. These are some common examples that you can use:
I hope you are well/all is well: It shows you care about that person. It&rsquo;s respectful and a safe phrase to initiate a friendly approach.
I hope you had a great weekend/week/day: It depends on which time or day of the week you are reaching out. This phrase is one of the most common in business emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I am writing to you about…&rdquo;
When you are emailing first, you need to introduce yourself and talk about the email&rsquo;s purpose. Sometimes you need to remind that person of who you are if you have been in contact before.
You can be impersonal or do your homework and research about the recipient. Because when you personalize your message to show you are familiar with their work or doings, you increase the chances of receiving a reply. Here are some examples of general email phrases for introductions and some inspirations for personalizing them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>General email phrases
It&rsquo;s [your name] from [your company]: Start by introducing yourself with your name and the company you work for. If you want to omit the company&rsquo;s name at the beginning, that&rsquo;s fine, but be sure that this information will be placed somewhere in the email body.
I am writing to you about… Here you can insert anything related to a previous conversation or meeting you had with the recipient. Also, you can use this introduction to talk about future events.
I am writing to ask/enquire/let you know/confirm/invite you to/to update you on/ask for…&quot;: Use this when you want to ask for information, a positioning, make an invitation without further ado. It&rsquo;s a way to be direct and keep the email short.
Might I take a moment of your time to…: If you want and/or need to be very formal, this is the best choice.
I am reaching out because…: It&rsquo;s an informal way to introduce the reason for your contact.
Personalized email phrases
I read your article about [topic] in [channel] yesterday/ this morning. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking about…: This is an example of how you can start a conversation about something the recipient has published or done recently. Ensure precisely what you&rsquo;re talking about to avoid misunderstandings and not to cause a contrary reaction to them.
Congratulations on [what the person has achieved]! I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s inspiring to see how this can help…: Sincere compliments are always welcomed. Once again, only talk about what you are sure about this achievement and don&rsquo;t exaggerate. Be completely honest with what you say to them.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>&ldquo;Thanks for…&rdquo;
Showing gratitude is an excellent way of keeping your recipient&rsquo;s attention and overcoming problems that come to you on customer service. Mainly because you need to focus on solving these issues as smoothly as possible.  And sometimes, the customer asked a simple question and didn&rsquo;t even know it was a mistake, and you end up exposing and highlighting it. Let&rsquo;s see some email phrases that will help in both cases:
Thanks for letting me know: This shows you acknowledge what the person has informed you and shows appreciation for that.
Thank you for your understanding/patience: This kind of message compliments the customer while you still acknowledge the problem they are having, without apologizing for mistakes unnecessarily.
Thank you for your email about…: This helps to remind the person about the matter you are talking about and opens up a more friendly conversation, depending on the content of previous emails.
Thanks for sending/asking about/attending: It shows people that you acknowledge their actions and appreciate them.
Thank you for reaching out (to me): This is a more informal way to appreciate someone&rsquo;s contact.
Thanks for your feedback on/your suggestion: It welcomes feedback and suggestions, making the person feel secure to continue giving them to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Extra tip: If you need to apologize for a major failure, use something simple like &ldquo;Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.&rdquo; But don&rsquo;t spend your whole email apologizing. Instead, offer solutions for what has happened. Avoid using &ldquo;Sorry for the inconvenience&rdquo; because it sounds vague, informal, and insincere.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Please feel welcomed…&rdquo;
Sometimes you&rsquo;re going to have to ask someone for help or more information. Use phrases that create an open door on your communication with your recipient in a manner that they will feel that it&rsquo;s possible to reach out to you whenever needed.
Remember to describe what you need first when you are asking for help. And whenever you&rsquo;re providing information, you should give them a way to contact you if they have questions.
Please feel welcomed…: The phrase, &ldquo;Please feel welcomed…&rdquo; invites customers to reach out more times and makes them feel comfortable to do so.
Could you please…?: It&rsquo;s a formal way of making requests, and ask for further explanations politely.
I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you could…: Another way of asking for something politely.
It would be very helpful if you could send us/me…: You show the person that their help is very appreciated. You can use it to send additional information or files.
Please keep me informed/posted/updated: This makes the communication open so that the person can reach any time with new information about a matter.
If possible, I&rsquo;d like to know (more) about…: You are not demanding anything, just letting the person feel comfortable sharing something specific with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;… please let me know.&rdquo;
If you want to offer to do something for someone in the email, then demonstrate that you are happy to do it. Show the receiver that you are there for assistance in whatever is necessary. These phrases show people that you wish to help them out gladly:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d be happy to…: It expresses that you don&rsquo;t mind helping, and the intention is to make the other person feel comfortable asking you anything they need.</li>
<li>If we can be of any further assistance, please let us know: It&rsquo;s a formal way of offering additional help.</li>
<li>Let me know if you need any help: It&rsquo;s the most common email phrase in this category. It&rsquo;s an informal way to let people know that you are open to assist them when they need it</li>
<li>… please do not hesitate to contact me: This works as a complement for phrases like &ldquo;If you need further information…&rdquo;. It emphasizes that you are willing to help.</li>
<li>… please feel free to contact me/to get in touch: It lets the person know that they can reach out to you whenever they need to.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately…&rdquo;
Giving bad news by email is never easy, but there are ways to do it properly. It sometimes happens that you couldn&rsquo;t attend to the person&rsquo;s expectations somehow, and you need to give this information.
Unfortunately, we cannot/we are unable to …: This is the formal and polite way of giving negative responses.
I&rsquo;m afraid it will not be possible to…: Use this informal phrase on a negative response, followed by a brief explanation of why it wasn&rsquo;t possible to accomplish the person&rsquo;s request.
We regret to inform you that…: It&rsquo;s a polite and formal way to give bad news. Right after saying this, explain the reasons why it won&rsquo;t happen.
After careful consideration, we have decided (not) to…: It shows that you have considered what the person has sent you previously. It&rsquo;s also a way to soften the gloomy reply.
It&rsquo;s against company policy to…: It&rsquo;s a way of explaining why you can&rsquo;t do something the person has requested when it goes against the company policy.
Despite my best efforts…:  You show the person you made efforts to solve something or give them a positive response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Looking forward to hearing from you.&rdquo;
When finishing your emails, rather than using &ldquo;Thanks again&rdquo; or something similar, create an expectation to be answered. Let the dialogue open. These phrases will encourage them to give any additional help or feedback you need.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Please let me know if this works/if you are available/if that sounds good/if you can/if you can help/if you need to reschedule…: It&rsquo;s a phrase to finish the email showing that you need a response about what you have sent to the recipient.</li>
<li>I look forward to seeing/meeting you: Use it when you are scheduling a personal appointment.</li>
<li>Any feedback you can give me on this would be highly/much appreciated: For when you need to finish the email asking for thoughts/feedback from the person.</li>
<li>I would appreciate your help in this matter: Usually, you finish an email with this phrase when you have described some situation or issue and need to ask for help with it.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li>Friendly email phrases to finish an email
Finally, you need to insert your goodbyes at the bottom of your email text. In business emails, you can&rsquo;t merely send &ldquo;Bye&rdquo; or &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo; Use one of these email phrases:
Best regards: It&rsquo;s a friendly way of saying goodbye and one of the most common in the business context. It may be best for people you have had conversations with before.
All the best: It&rsquo;s colloquial but a friendly and social way to say goodbye.
Sincerely: It&rsquo;s a formal business close, and one you are certainly not offending anyone by using.
Cheers: You can use this sign-off with your friends and close business colleagues. Depending on the voice tone you have for your brand, it also can be useful.
Have a great week/weekend/day/night!: It depends on which time you are sending the email. Be aware of timezones if you are exchanging emails with people from another country.</li>

<p>================================</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Responding to an Inquiry
If you&rsquo;re writing to reply to an inquiry (a request for information) you need to use the first sentence to let your reader know this is what you&rsquo;re doing.
You&rsquo;re also going to want to create goodwill (friendly and good feelings) with this person who may be your client or customer. Including the following sentences in your email helps do this:
•	&ldquo;Thank you for your interest.&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Thanks for choosing…&rdquo;
In this situation, you&rsquo;re probably going to be sending some type of attachment to provide information. You can use the language for sending attachments and follow it up with:
•	&ldquo;We hope you find this satisfactory.&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;We hope you are happy/satisfied with this.&rdquo;
Here&rsquo;s an example of how you might respond to an inquiry about the cost to install windows in a house:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing to respond to your inquiry about the cost of installing windows in your house (opening sentence). Please find our price list attached (file attachment). Do not hesitate to contact me if you need any assistance. Thank you for your interest in Acme Enterprises (building goodwill/friendly ending).&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informing Someone About Something
While what you want to inform the reader of will change from email to email, certain key phrases can help you get your message across clearly.
Here are some opening sentence phrases you can use:
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to inform you of…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing to tell you about…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Just a note to say…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Just to update you on…&rdquo;
Depending on your relationship with the reader, you can get a bit more creative. If you have a more informal relationship and know each other well, you can try using phrases like these:
•	&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the low-down on…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;FYI: This is to let you know…&rdquo; (FYI stands for &ldquo;For Your Information.&rdquo;)
Toward the end of the email, you may want to add:
&ldquo;Hope this helps.&rdquo;
You may also want to offer to give additional information if needed:
•	&ldquo;Let me/us know if you need anything else.&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Let me know if I can help you further.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirming Arrangements
Writing to confirm arrangements? Let your reader(s) know this in the opening sentence:
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to confirm…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Just writing to confirm…&rdquo;
Or you could set a more informal tone by writing:
&ldquo;Tuesday is good for me.&rdquo; (Especially if they have already suggested Tuesday.)
A nice way to end is to write:
&ldquo;Looking forward to seeing/meeting…&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing Arrangements
Oh no! You&rsquo;ve made arrangements and now you have to change them. How do you politely let someone know this?
Any of these sentences and phrases should work:
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I can&rsquo;t do/make Tuesday…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;This is to let you know that I&rsquo;ve had to put off/postpone…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing to call off/cancel…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t make/manage Wednesday. How about Friday instead?&rdquo;
You don&rsquo;t have to go into detail about why you need to change arrangements. The point of your email is simply to change arrangements. Keep it clear and brief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replying to a Previous Email
When you reach out by email to someone you don&rsquo;t know and they write back, the polite thing to do is thank them for their time. Here&rsquo;s how you can do that:
&ldquo;Thanks/Thank you for your email…&rdquo;
If someone has sent you an email and you write back, you can use one of these phrases at the beginning:
•	&ldquo;In reply to your email, here are …&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Re: your email, I …&rdquo;
What else can be in your reply? Well, you might have to send attachments. If so, you&rsquo;ll find the sentence, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find ___ attached,&rdquo; valuable.
There are times, however, when you might not have all of the necessary information available. Then you might have to make a promise to get back to the sender by writing:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back to you ASAP.&rdquo; (ASAP stands for &ldquo;As Soon As Possible.&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giving Good News
Who doesn&rsquo;t want to hear good news? Set the tone for your email right away by telling your reader you&rsquo;re writing with good news. The words &ldquo;pleased,&rdquo; &ldquo;happy&rdquo; and  &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; work well. Include them in sentences like these:
•	&ldquo;I am/We are pleased to inform you…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to tell you…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be happy/delighted to hear that…&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giving Bad News
Certain words let people know that bad news is coming. I&rsquo;m talking about words like &ldquo;regret,&rdquo; &ldquo;sorry,&rdquo; &ldquo;afraid&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfortunately.&rdquo;
Unfortunately (you see I just used one), you&rsquo;ll have to give bad news about business issues from time to time. Here are some sentence openings you can write to tell bad news as nicely as possible:
•	&ldquo;We regret to tell/inform you…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I am afraid that…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Unfortunately…&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complaining
Complaining can be tough. But it&rsquo;s easier to get what you want if you complain in a way that doesn&rsquo;t offend your reader. The way to do that in an email is to not be too emotional and to make your complaint clear and specific.
The following phrases can help you get started:
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing to complain (about…)&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I was disappointed to find/hear…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Unfortunately …&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making Inquiries
How can you ask someone to give you information? Start by using polite language to request what you want.
•	&ldquo;I am interested in receiving/finding out…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I would like to receive…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;I would be grateful if…&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Could/Can you please send me…?&rdquo;
Are you sure that the person you are writing to can help you? Don&rsquo;t worry if you aren&rsquo;t. Just ask by writing:
•	&ldquo;Would you be able to (help)…?&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Can you help?&rdquo;
If you need an answer quickly, don&rsquo;t assume the person you&rsquo;re writing to understands this. Let them know by writing it:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d appreciate a reply ASAP.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requesting Action
There are times when you want someone to do something for you. Here are useful phrases you can use to make your request:
•	&ldquo;Can you send ___ to me by Friday, please?&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Please get/keep in touch.&rdquo;
•	&ldquo;Keep me posted.&rdquo;
Note that the word &ldquo;please&rdquo; can keep your request from sounding like an order.</p>
</li>

<p>How to Use &ldquo;Would You Mind&rdquo; To Make Polite Requests in Formal Settings
&ldquo;Would You Mind&rdquo; is a very polite way of making requests in formal contexts. One very important thing to mention here is that when you use &ldquo;would you mind&rdquo; to make requests, the verb form should be a present participle (base+ing). The following examples will make the idea clearer.<br>
Would you mind joining the meeting this afternoon?
Would you mind writing a letter on behalf of all of us?
Would you mind passing the file to me?</p>
<p>How to Use &ldquo;Do You Mind&rdquo; To Make Polite Requests in Formal Settings
You can replace the expression &ldquo;Would You Mind&rdquo; with &ldquo;Do You Mind.&rdquo; Both can serve the same purpose of making requests in formal contexts. When you use &ldquo;Do you mind&rdquo; to make requests, you also use the present participle form (base+ing) of the verb. The following examples would make the idea clearer.
Do you mind joining the meeting this afternoon?
Do you mind writing a letter on behalf of all of us?
Do you mind passing the file to me?</p>
<p>How to Use &ldquo;Do You Think You Could,&rdquo; To Make Polite Requests in Formal Settings
You can also make requests by starting with &ldquo;Do You Think You Could…&rdquo; The following examples will make the idea clearer.
Do you think you could join the meeting this afternoon?
Do you think you could write a letter on behalf of all of us?
Do you think you could pass the file to me?
Remember! In formal settings, you don&rsquo;t ask for anything directly. If you ask for anything directly, it may appear to be orders rather than requests.</p>
<p>Some Other Ways to Make Polite Requests in Formal Settings
In addition to the above expressions, there are plenty of polite expressions to make requests. Let&rsquo;s have a look at some examples.</p>
<p>How to Use &ldquo;I was wondering if it would be possible for you to…&rdquo;
I was wondering if it would be possible for you to send me the e-mail again.<br>
I was wondering if it would be possible for you to call me again this afternoon.
I was wondering if it would be possible for you to help me with this problem.</p>
<p>How to Use &ldquo;Is there any chance that you could…&rdquo;
Is there any chance that you could do it later?<br>
Is there any chance that you could finish the task by tonight?<br>
Is there any chance that you could arrange the meeting tomorrow?</p>
<p>How to Use &ldquo;Would it be alright if you…&rdquo;
Would it be alright if you call me at 10 PM?<br>
Would it be alright if you attend the whole seminar?<br>
Would it be alright if you do this for me?</p>

Dear Hiring Manager,
My name is Cody Fredrickson, and I am a marketing manager interested in open opportunities at your company. Crane &amp; Jenkins has a reputation in the community for creating innovative marketing campaigns based on a foundation of strategic market research. With more than five years&rsquo; experience at leading agencies, I&rsquo;ve cultivated a talent for developing creative and successful marketing strategies. I&rsquo;m looking to combine my skills and my desire to serve the community with Crane &amp; Jenkins&rsquo; extensive nonprofit client portfolio.
During my previous role at Cloud Clearwater, I developed three of the agency&rsquo;s top-producing advertising campaigns. My work included a rebranding campaign that generated a 57% increase in response rates, an email win-back strategy that netted more than $1 million in renewed accounts, and a CLIO-nominated mobile retargeting campaign for the company&rsquo;s biggest client. I was commended by my manager for demonstrating strong skills in developing high-value client relationships, inspiring innovative creativity, and finding new ways to grow revenue in key target verticals.
As someone who has led more than 20 major digital marketing campaigns in the last two years, I prioritize the need to stay on top of the latest trends and remain adaptable in the rapidly changing digital marketing environment. I am strongly committed to continuing to refine my skills, and my passion for technology has kept me on the cutting edge of mobile marketing strategies.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I have long admired Crane &amp; Jenkin&rsquo;s dedication to making a difference both for their clients and ultimately for the underserved in the world. As these are values I carry into my own work, I am eager to have the opportunity to join your team. I believe my digital marketing skills will bring a competitive advantage to Crane &amp; Jenkins, and I hope to meet with you to discuss how we can best work together.
Sincerely,
Cody Fredrickson</p>

<p>Cloud Clearwater
777 Willow Road</p>
<p>Dear Patricia Moore,</p>
<p>My name is Sofia Flores and I am reaching out as a regular patron of Cloud Clearwater. I love the inviting atmosphere and warm smiles I receive when arriving at your coffee shop. As an experienced barista, I wanted to introduce myself and explore if there are any opportunities available for me to join your staff. I am not just another young adult looking for a job at a coffee shop. I live and breathe coffee, and I absolutely adore Cloud Clearwater.
At my last position as Barista for the coffee shop at Retail Ocean, I perfected our signature coffee swirl in a record two weeks. In 14 days, I learned to not only make the lattes themselves but also craft an absolutely perfect ocean wave atop the steaming cup, and I know that I could quickly learn to craft any foam creation for this new position. Beyond that, I would love to branch out from my coffee interests to pastries, teas and the other menu items offered at Cloud Clearwater.
I am outgoing, extroverted, and would easily blend with the already vibrant staff employed with Cloud Clearwater. I work extremely well under pressure, and I can grin on cue despite the morning and evening rushes that might stress some people out. In addition to all of these skills, I also have a fantastic memory and have been known to memorize drink orders to faces, therefore speeding up clogged lines. Along with these behind-the-counter talents, I am also dedicated to the tasks that aren&rsquo;t coffee related too. Stocking can be fun, and I would love to join the team to be the Barista you need when you need it!
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon. I can be reached at either sflores@email.com or (123) 456-7891.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sofia Flores</p>
